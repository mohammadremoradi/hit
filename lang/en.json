    "why reason title one": "1. Initial Employment",
    "why reason text one": "The need for IT specialists is enormous and there aren't enough skilled people to fill the gap, therefore tech organizations are eager to hire them. Because there is such a tremendous need for qualified experts, even those without a college degree can readily obtain employment. Tech students are known to work as independent contractors while they are in school to supplement their income.",

    "why reason text two": "The field of information technology is not one-sided. It has connections to every other industry, making it a flexible field for employment.

    "why reason text three": "IT specialists develop along with technology as it advances. The position requires it. However, compared to other industries, their ability to advance their careers quickly is made possible by their relentless pursuit of information. Tech professionals begin their careers at entry-level and advance to a mid-level managerial role within a few years. It is also quite common for businesses to look for exceptional students before they graduate.",
    "why reason title four": "4. It's Financially rewarding",
    "why reason text four": "Tech experts are valued for their specialized skill sets. They are therefore priceless assets in any company. Therefore, even at junior or entry-level employment, their salary for their work is far more than the average norm.",
    "why reason title five": "5. Less reliance on a university degree",
    "why reason text five": "The IT industry is one of the few sectors where university degrees are losing their importance day by day and employers mostly care about the practical skills of the applicant instead of having a university degree. This is quite significant as the applicants who have an unrelated degree or even dont have one can still find a career if they have the necessary skills."
